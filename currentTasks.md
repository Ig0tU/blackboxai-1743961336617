The following guides provide examples of accomplishing specific things with your bot.

The examples assume that you have installed the latest version of fastapi_poe (you can install this using pip by running pip install fastapi_poe. The full code examples also assume that you are hosting your bot on Modal. Although we recommend Modal for it's simplicity, you should be able to deploy your server bot on any cloud provider. To learn how to setup Modal, please follow Steps 1 and 2 in our Quick start. If you already have Modal set up, simply copy the full code examples into a file called main.py and then run modal deploy main.py. Modal will then deploy your bot server to the cloud and output the server url. Use that url when creating a server bot on Poe. Accessing other bots on Poe The Poe bot query API allows creators to invoke other bots on Poe (which includes bots created by Poe like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-Instant and bots created by other creators) and this access is provided for free so that creators do not have to worry about LLM costs. For every user message, server bot creators get to make up to ten calls to another bot of their choice.

Declare dependency in your PoeBot class You have to declare your bot dependencies using the settings endpoint.

Python

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse: return fp.SettingsResponse(server_bot_dependencies={"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 1}) In your get_response handler, use the stream_request function to invoke any bot you want. The following is an example where we forward the user's query to GPT-3.5-Turbo and return the result.

Python

async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: async for msg in fp.stream_request( request, "GPT-3.5-Turbo", request.access_key ): yield msg The final code for your PoeBot should look like:

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

class GPT35TurboBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: async for msg in fp.stream_request( request, "GPT-3.5-Turbo", request.access_key ): # Add whatever logic you'd like here before yielding the result! yield msg

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse:
    return fp.SettingsResponse(server_bot_dependencies={"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 1})
Thats it! Try chatting with your bot now, and you should see responses from GPT-3.5-Turbo.

üöß Warning

If you see some error related to bot call counts, it's possible your dependencies are not updated properly. See Updating Bot Settings for possible resolutions.

Accessing a media generation bot on Poe If you would like to call an image/video/audio generation bot (or any other bot that outputs file attachments) on Poe, you can do so using the same stream_request function. The function will yield a PartialResponse object with the attachment in the attachment field for every file it outputs.

Python

class Imagen3Bot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]:

    sent_files = []
    async for msg in fp.stream_request(
        request, "Imagen-3", request.access_key
    ):
        # Add whatever logic you'd like to handle text responses from the Bot
        pass
        # If there is an attachment, add it to the list of sent files
        if msg.attachment:
            sent_files.append(msg.attachment)

    for file in sent_files:
        yield PartialResponse(text=f"Received file {file.name} hosted at {file.url}")

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse:
    return fp.SettingsResponse(server_bot_dependencies={"Imagen-3": 1})
In this example, we just yield the file name and url as a text response. If you would like your bot to yield the attachment, see Sending files with your response.

Rendering an image in your response The Poe API allows you to embed images in your bot's response using Markdown syntax. The following is an example implementation describing a bot that returns a static response containing an image.

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

IMAGE_URL = "https://images.pexels.com/photos/46254/leopard-wildcat-big-cat-botswana-46254.jpeg"

class SampleImageResponseBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: yield fp.PartialResponse(text=f"This is a test image. leopard") The following is what the response looks like for someone using the above described bot.

Rendering HTML in your response Using a HTML code block If a Markdown message contains a HTML code block, both the code block and the preview will be rendered. Note that the code block content must begin with <html>.

For example the following message:

md

<html>
  <h1>hello world</h1>
</html>
Will render like this:

Using inline HTML If a bot's Markdown output contains a block outside a code block, the HTML block will be rendered without displaying the code.

The following message:

<html> <h1>hello world</h1> </html> Will render like this:
‚ùóÔ∏è Avoid Empty Lines

The HTML block should not contain any empty lines, as Markdown will interpret these as separate blocks, breaking the HTML structure.

Embedding an iframe in a message When a bot's markdown output contains <iframe src="{{url}}"> outside of a code block, the iframe will be rendered. For best results, always include the height attribute.

The following message:

<iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBxblAUN3ro?si=K9BxwGdjexz1Vf_4"></iframe> Will render like this:
Enabling file upload for your bot The Poe API allows your bot to take files as input. There are several settings designed to streamline the process of enabling file uploads for your bot:

allow_attachments (default False): Turning this on will allow Poe users to send files to your bot. Attachments will be sent as attachment objects with url, content_type, and name. expand_text_attachments (default True): If allow_attachments=True, Poe will parse text files and send their content in the parsed_content field of the attachment object. enable_image_comprehension (default False): If allow_attachments=True, Poe will use image vision to generate a description of image attachments and send their content in the parsed_content field of the attachment object. If this is enabled, the Poe user will only be able to send at most one image per message due to image vision limitations. Python

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse: return fp.SettingsResponse( allow_attachments=True, expand_text_attachments=True, enable_image_comprehension=True ) That's it! Your bot should now be able to handle image and text attachments in addition to the user's chat input. üéâ

Note: If you have either attachment parsing setting on (expand_text_attachments or enable_image_comprehension), fastapi_poe will automatically add user-role messages containing each file's parsed_content into the conversation prior to the last user message. See templates.py for how the file contents are added. Note that because this adds additional user-role messages to the conversation, if the LLM you are using requires role alternation between the bot and the user, you will need to reformat the conversation. make_prompt_author_role_alternated is provided to help with that.

If you would like to disable the file content insertion, you can use should_insert_attachment_messages=False when initializing your PoeBot class. You can also override insert_attachment_messages() if you want to use your own templates.

Python

bot = YourBot(should_insert_attachment_messages=False)
app = make_app(bot) Parsing your own files If your expected filetypes are not supported, or you want to perform more complex operations and would rather handle the file contents yourself, that is also possible using the file url, which is passed in through the attachment object. Here is an example of setting up a bot which counts the number of pages in a PDF document.

We will utilize a python library called pypdf2 (which you can install using pip install pypdf2) to parse the pdf and count the number of pages. We will use the requests library (which you can install using pip install requests) to download the file.

Python

def _fetch_pdf_and_count_num_pages(url: str) -> int: response = requests.get(url) if response.status_code != 200: raise FileDownloadError() with open("temp_pdf_file.pdf", "wb") as f: f.write(response.content) reader = PdfReader("temp_pdf_file.pdf") return len(reader.pages) Now we will set up a bot class that will iterate through the user messages and identify the latest pdf file to compute the number of pages for.

Python

class PDFSizeBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: for message in reversed(request.query): for attachment in message.attachments: if attachment.content_type == "application/pdf": try: num_pages = _fetch_pdf_and_count_num_pages(attachment.url) yield fp.PartialResponse(text=f"{attachment.name} has {num_pages} pages") except FileDownloadError: yield fp.PartialResponse(text="Failed to retrieve the document.") return The final code should look like:

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

class FileDownloadError(Exception): pass

def _fetch_pdf_and_count_num_pages(url: str) -> int: response = requests.get(url) if response.status_code != 200: raise FileDownloadError() with open("temp_pdf_file.pdf", "wb") as f: f.write(response.content) reader = PdfReader("temp_pdf_file.pdf") return len(reader.pages)

class PDFSizeBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: for message in reversed(request.query): for attachment in message.attachments: if attachment.content_type == "application/pdf": try: num_pages = _fetch_pdf_and_count_num_pages(attachment.url) yield fp.PartialResponse(text=f"{attachment.name} has {num_pages} pages") except FileDownloadError: yield fp.PartialResponse(text="Failed to retrieve the document.") return

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse:
    return fp.SettingsResponse(allow_attachments=True)
Sending files with your response The Poe API allows you to send attachments with your bot response. When using the fastapi_poe library, send file attachments with your bot response by calling post_message_attachment within the get_response function of your bot.

Example In this example, the bot will take the input from the user, write it into a text file, and attach that text file in the response to the user. Copy the following code into a file called main.py (you can pick any name but the deployment commands that follow assume that this is the file name). Change the access_key stub with your actual key that you can generate on the create bot page.

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

class AttachmentOutputDemoBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: await self.post_message_attachment( message_id=request.message_id, file_data=request.query[-1].content, filename="dummy.txt" ) yield fp.PartialResponse(text=f"Attached a text file containing your last message.") üìò Limitations

The access_key should be the key associated with the bot sending the response. It can be found in the edit bot page. It does not matter where post_message_attachment is called, as long as it is within the body of get_response. It can be called multiple times to attach multiple (up to 20) files. A file should not be larger than 50MB. Rendering an audio player in your response If an attachment is an audio file, you'll see an audio player display. The following is an example implementation describing a bot that returns a response containing an audio file.

Python

AUDIO_URL = "..."

class AttachmentOutputDemoBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: await self.post_message_attachment( message_id=request.message_id, download_url=AUDIO_URL ) yield fp.PartialResponse(text="Hi")

Our audio player currently supports the following file types:

audio/mpeg (mp3) audio/wav audio/mp4 audio/webm Rendering a video player in your response If an attachment is one of the following: quicktime, mpeg, mp4, mpg, avi, x-msvideo, x-ms-wmv, or x-flv you‚Äôll see an video player display. The following is an example implementation describing a bot that returns a response containing an video file.

Python

VIDEO_URL = "..."

class AttachmentOutputDemoBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: await self.post_message_attachment( message_id=request.message_id, download_url=VIDEO_URL ) yield fp.PartialResponse(text="")

Creating bots that help their users create prompt bots Your bot can help users create prompt bots with pre-filled fields. Here are some example use-case for this:

Your bot helps users do prompt engineering, then provides a link the user can use to create a bot easily with the prompt they have developed. When a user uploads training data, your bot could run fine-tuning and provide a link to create a new prompt bot. This new bot's prompt would include the fine-tuned model ID, which its base bot can extract from the prompt to do inference. More specifically, your bot‚Äôs response can contain a link to pre-fill the form fields on poe.com/create_bot by passing GET parameters. The user can submit the form as-is or manually edit before submitting. The supported GET parameters are:

prompt ‚Äî this is the string which will pre-fill the prompt section on the form. base_bot ‚Äî this is the string name for a bot to pre-select from the base bot list on the form.* Python

import urllib

class FineTuneTrainingBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: fine_tune_id = my_api.generate_fine_tune_id(request) params = { "prompt": f"{{user_prompt}} --fine-tune-id {fine_tune_id}", "base_bot": "FineTuneInferenceBot" } url_base = "https://poe.com/create_bot?" url_params = urllib.parse.urlencode(params) yield fp.PartialResponse( text=f"Finish creating your bot.") *If you are interested in including your bot in this list, please reach out to developers@poe.com

Setting an introduction message The Poe API allows you to set a friendly introduction message for your bot, providing you with a way to instruct the users on how they should use the bot. In order to do so, you have to override get_settings and set the parameter called introduction_message to whatever you want that message to be.

Python

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse: return fp.SettingsResponse( introduction_message="Welcome to the trivia bot. Please provide me a topic that you would like me to quiz you on." ) The final code looks like:

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

class TriviaBotSample(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response(self, query: fp.QueryRequest) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: # implement the trivia bot. yield fp.PartialResponse(text="Bot under construction. Please visit later")

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse:
    return fp.SettingsResponse(
        introduction_message="Welcome to the trivia bot. Please provide me a topic that you would like me to quiz you on."
    )
Multi Bot Support The Poe client support @-mentioning other bots within the same chat. To include this support in with your bot, you need to enable enable_multi_bot_chat_prompting (Default False) in your bot settings. When this is enabled, Poe will check the previous chat history to see if there are multiple bots, and if so, it will combine the previous messages and add prompting such that your bot will have sufficient context about the conversation so far.

If this setting is not enabled, you will continue to see bot/user messages as separate ProtocolMessages just like before.

Updating bot settings Bots on poe each have settings that control how the bot behaves. For example, one such setting is server_bot_dependencies, which allows you to call other bots on poe. It is important to note that after modifying these settings, (i.e. after modifying get_settings() in your PoeBot class), these updates still need to be sent to the Poe servers. This is typically done automatically on server bot startup, within fastapi_poe's make_app function,

‚ùóÔ∏è Warning!!!

If you are not using fastapi_poe or you do not provide the access_key and bot_name into make_app() (see configuring access credentials), you will need to manually sync these settings using the steps below.

Modify the bot settings to your desired specification If you are using the fastapi_poe library, then you just need to implement the get_settings method in the PoeBot class. The following is an example:
Python

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse: return fp.SettingsResponse(allow_attachments=True, server_bot_dependencies={"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 1, "Claude-instant": 1}) 2. Get your access key and bot name You can find both the access key and the bot name in the "edit bot" page by clicking on your bot -> clicking the triple dots -> edit bot.

Make a post request to Poe's refetch settings endpoint with your bot name and access key. This is done by callingfp.client.sync_bot_settings from within a python script.
Python

import fastapi_poe as fp

Replace the bot name and access key with information of your bot
bot_name = "server_bot_name" access_key = "your_server_bot_access_key"

fp.sync_bot_settings(bot_name, access_key) If you are not using the python fastapi_poe library, you can also use curl:

curl -X POST https://api.poe.com/bot/fetch_settings/<botname>/<access_key>

Note that it is highly recommended to use fastapi_poe, and some features may not work smoothly without it.

Using OpenAI function calling The Poe API allows you to use OpenAI function calling when accessing OpenAI models. In order to use this feature, you will simply need to provide a tools list which contains objects describing your function and an executables list which contains functions that correspond to the tools list. The following is an example.

Python

def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"): """Get the current weather in a given location""" if "tokyo" in location.lower(): return json.dumps({"location": "Tokyo", "temperature": "11", "unit": unit}) elif "san francisco" in location.lower(): return json.dumps( {"location": "San Francisco", "temperature": "72", "unit": unit} ) elif "paris" in location.lower(): return json.dumps({"location": "Paris", "temperature": "22", "unit": unit}) else: return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})

tools_executables = [get_current_weather]

tools_dict_list = [ { "type": "function", "function": { "name": "get_current_weather", "description": "Get the current weather in a given location", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "location": { "type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA", }, "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]}, }, "required": ["location"], }, }, } ] tools = [fp.ToolDefinition(**tools_dict) for tools_dict in tools_dict_list] Additionally, you will need to define a dependency of two calls on an OpenAI model of your choice (in this case, the GPT-3.5-Turbo). You need a dependency of two because as part of the OpenAI function calling flow, you need to call OpenAI twice. Adjust this dependency limit if you want to make more than one function calling request while computing your response.

Python

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse: return fp.SettingsResponse(server_bot_dependencies={"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 2}) The final code (including the setup code you need to host this on Modal) that goes into your main.py is as follows:

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"): """Get the current weather in a given location""" if "tokyo" in location.lower(): return json.dumps({"location": "Tokyo", "temperature": "11", "unit": unit}) elif "san francisco" in location.lower(): return json.dumps( {"location": "San Francisco", "temperature": "72", "unit": unit} ) elif "paris" in location.lower(): return json.dumps({"location": "Paris", "temperature": "22", "unit": unit}) else: return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})

tools_executables = [get_current_weather]

tools_dict_list = [ { "type": "function", "function": { "name": "get_current_weather", "description": "Get the current weather in a given location", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "location": { "type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA", }, "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]}, }, "required": ["location"], }, }, } ] tools = [fp.ToolDefinition(**tools_dict) for tools_dict in tools_dict_list]

class GPT35FunctionCallingBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: async for msg in fp.stream_request( request, "GPT-3.5-Turbo", request.access_key, tools=tools, tool_executables=tools_executables, ): yield msg

async def get_settings(self, setting: fp.SettingsRequest) -> fp.SettingsResponse:
    return fp.SettingsResponse(server_bot_dependencies={"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 2})
Storing Metadata with a Bot Response Bots can persist additional data about their response by yielding a DataResponse. This metadata is stored in the metadata field of the associated ProtocolMessage and will be available in future requests to the same bot. This enables state management across multiple messages in a conversation without exposing internal details to users.

For example, consider some troubleshooting bot that uses metadata to track which diagnostic steps have been attempted:

Python

class TroubleShootingBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response( self, request: fp.QueryRequest ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]:

    diagnosis_steps_to_directions = {
        "Check printer light": "Check the light on the top of the printer.",
        "Check connection": "Check the printer is connected to wifi.",
        "Check drivers": "Check your device has the latest drivers."
    }

    # Access metadata to remove steps that have already been tried.
    for prev_message in request.query:
        if prev_message.role == "bot" and prev_message.metadata is not None:
            message_metadata = json.loads(prev_message.metadata)
            if message_metadata.get("diagnosis_step") is not None:
                diagnosis_steps_to_directions.pop(message_metadata["diagnosis_step"])

    # If there are no remaining steps, return a message saying so.
    if not diagnosis_steps_to_directions:
        yield fp.PartialResponse(text="I've tried everything.")
        return

    # Recommend a next step
    recommended_next_step = random.choice(list(diagnosis_steps_to_directions.keys()))
    yield fp.PartialResponse(text=diagnosis_steps_to_directions[recommended_next_step])

    # Persist the recommended step in the message metadata
    yield fp.DataResponse(
        metadata=json.dumps({"diagnosis_step": recommended_next_step}),
    )
Beyond storing conversation state, DataResponse can also be useful for persisting data that doesn't make sense to expose to the user, like identifiers or performance metrics.

üìò Important Notes

Only yield one DataResponse per request - if multiple are sent, only the last one is stored Metadata is only visible to the bot that created it - so using this field to pass data between bots will not work. Accessing HTTP request information In the special case that you need to access specific http information about the requests coming to your bot, our python client (fastapi_poe) exposes the underlying Starlette Request object in the ".http_request" attribute of the request object passed to the query handler. This allows you to access the request information such as the url and query params. The following is an example (including the setup code you need to host this on Modal):

Python Full Setup Code (Python)

class HttpRequestBot(fp.PoeBot): async def get_response_with_context( self, request: fp.QueryRequest, context: fp.RequestContext ) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]: request_url = context.http_request.url query_params = context.http_request.query_params yield fp.PartialResponse( text=f"The request url is: {request_url}, query params are: {query_params}" )

Programmatically Accessing a Poe Bot For certain use cases, like running unit tests or other offline computation outside the context of a particular request to your server bot, or to do queries that you as a creator want to use your own Poe account to pay for (as opposed to offloading those costs to a user), you may want to query other Poe bots under your own API key. See the External Application Guide for more details on how to do this.

Thought for 6 seconds
Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want a bash script to set up a Poe server bot that uses enterprise bots with Poe covering the costs. They also need two scripts: one to run locally and another to automate Git and deployment to a platform like Vercel or Netlify, prompting for API keys and space names.

First, I need to recall how Poe's server bots work. From the provided documentation, the key points are using the fastapi_poe library and declaring dependencies in the get_settings method. The example given uses Modal for deployment, but the user might want a more general approach, maybe using a different hosting service.

The local setup script should install dependencies, set up the project structure, and run the server. The user mentioned they have all credentials, so the script should prompt for the access key and bot name. The example code from Poe's guide uses a class that streams another bot's response, so the script should generate a basic main.py with placeholders for those credentials.

For the deployment part, the user wants automation with Git. The second script should handle creating a Git repo, adding files, committing, pushing to a remote, and then deploying. They might be using a platform like Vercel, which can deploy from GitHub. The script needs to prompt for the GitHub token, repo name, and deployment platform details. However, since the exact platform isn't specified, I'll make it generic, maybe using Vercel as an example.

Wait, the user mentioned "space" which could refer to Vercel's Spaces or another service. I'll assume Vercel. The deployment script would need to install the Vercel CLI, log in, and deploy. But since the user might not have the CLI installed, the script should check and install it if needed.

Potential issues: The user might not have Python 3.10+ installed, but the script should handle that with a virtualenv. Also, ensuring that the main.py is correctly configured with their access key and bot name. The deployment script needs to handle different platforms, but without specifics, I'll stick to Vercel steps.

Another point: The Poe server requires an API key and bot name, which are used in the main.py. The local script should prompt for these and insert them into the code. The deployment script would then push the code with those values set.

Testing the scripts: The local script should run the server, and the deployment script should push to Git and deploy. Need to make sure the scripts are interactive, using read commands for inputs and handling errors like missing commands (git, curl, etc.).

Putting it all together, the first script sets up the project, installs dependencies, and runs the server. The second script initializes Git, commits, pushes, and deploys. Both scripts should be robust with error checking and clear prompts.

Here's a bash script setup for your Poe server bot, split into two parts:

1. Local Setup Script (setup_poe_bot.sh)

Okay, the user provided a lot of URLs related to Poe's documentation. Let me see what they need. They might be confused or overwhelmed by all the links. The previous conversation was about setting up a bash script for a Poe bot server. Now, they pasted a bunch of URLs, maybe they want help navigating these docs or need a specific part explained?

Looking at the URLs, many are from Poe's Creator Guide sections like "Accessing other bots", "Functional Guides", "Settings", etc. The user might be trying to implement something specific mentioned in those docs but needs guidance. Since their last message was just the URLs without a question, perhaps they want me to explain how to use these resources or point out key sections?

Alternatively, maybe they encountered an error while following the setup and need troubleshooting. The previous assistant provided scripts, but maybe they hit a snag. The URLs include sections on dependencies, file handling, metadata, etc. Maybe they need help with a particular part of the setup mentioned in those docs?

I should ask for clarification. They might need help with a specific feature from the docs they linked, like setting up dependencies, handling files, or deploying. Since the URLs cover various topics, I can't be sure. The best approach is to prompt them to specify what they're trying to achieve or which part of the documentation they're stuck on. That way, I can provide targeted assistance instead of guessing.

It looks like you've shared a list of Poe documentation URLs. Could you clarify what specific help you need related to these resources? For example:

Are you trying to implement a particular feature shown in the docs?
Are you encountering an error while following a guide?
Do you need help understanding a specific section of the documentation?
Are you trying to connect different parts of the documentation for a particular use case?
Let me know what you're working on so I can provide the most relevant assistance!

Okay, the user wants to set up a Poe server bot that's free for users because they're covering the inference costs. Let me break this down.

First, I need to recall how Poe's server bots work. From the previous conversation, I know that server bots can call other bots on Poe, and Poe covers the cost for those calls up to a limit. The user wants their bot to be free for end-users, so they need to handle the costs through their own Poe account's credits or via Poe's enterprise arrangement.

The user mentioned "app-creator" but probably means they want to create an app that acts as a server bot. The key points are:

Server Bot Setup: They need to create a server bot that uses other bots (like GPT-3.5-Turbo) and have Poe cover the costs. This requires declaring dependencies in the bot's settings.

Free for Users: Since Poe allows up to 10 free calls per user message, the bot's logic should stay within that limit. The user's Poe account will be billed, so they need to ensure they have enough credits or an enterprise plan.

Deployment: They need to deploy the server bot so it's accessible. The previous answer provided a bash script for local setup and deployment, but maybe they need more details on deployment options (like Vercel, Heroku, or AWS).

Cost Management: They should be aware of Poe's cost structure. If their bot becomes popular, costs could add up. They might need to monitor usage or set up alerts.

Looking at their previous request, they wanted a bash script for setup and deployment. The initial answer provided scripts for local setup and Git deployment. Now, they might need to ensure that the server bot is configured correctly to use Poe's free calls and that their credentials are properly set.

Possible steps to confirm:

Ensure the server_bot_dependencies in get_settings is correctly set to the bots they want to use (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo).
Use the access key from their Poe account to authenticate the server bot.
Deploy the server with proper environment variables for the access key and bot name.
Test the bot to confirm it's using the dependent bots and that costs are being applied to their account.
Potential issues could be incorrect dependency declarations, missing access keys, or deployment configuration errors. I should provide a concise example of the Python code setup and deployment steps, emphasizing the dependency declaration and authentication.

To create a free-to-use server bot on Poe where you cover the inference costs, you'll need to set up a server bot that leverages Poe's free call credits or enterprise arrangements. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Prerequisites
Poe Account: Ensure you have a Poe account with sufficient credits (or enterprise access).
Bot Credentials: Create a new server bot on Poe and note its Bot Name and Access Key (found in the bot's settings).
Dependencies: Choose which Poe bots (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude-Instant) your server bot will use. Poe covers the cost of up to 10 free calls per user message for these dependencies.
2. Code Setup
Create a Python file (e.g., main.py) with the following structure:

python
Run
Copy code
from fastapi_poe import PoeBot, make_app, stream_request
from fastapi_poe.types import QueryRequest, PartialResponse

class MyFreeBot(PoeBot):
    async def get_response(self, request: QueryRequest) -> PartialResponse:
        # Example: Forward user input to GPT-3.5-Turbo
        async for msg in stream_request(
            request, "GPT-3.5-Turbo", request.access_key
        ):
            yield msg

    async def get_settings(self, setting):
        # Declare dependencies (up to 10 free calls per message)
        return self.settings.copy(
            update={
                "server_bot_dependencies": {"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 1},
                "allow_attachments": False,  # Adjust as needed
            }
        )

# Initialize the app with your Poe credentials
app = make_app(
    MyFreeBot(),
    bot_name="YOUR_BOT_NAME",
    access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
)
Key Points:

Replace YOUR_BOT_NAME and YOUR_ACCESS_KEY with your Poe bot's credentials.
Adjust server_bot_dependencies to include the bots you want to use (e.g., {"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 1, "Claude-Instant": 1}).
The stream_request function forwards user input to the dependent bot, and Poe covers the cost.
3. Local Testing
Run the server locally to test:

bash
Run
Copy code
# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi_poe uvicorn

# Run the server
uvicorn main:app --reload
4. Deployment
Deploy your bot to a cloud provider (e.g., Vercel, Heroku, AWS Lambda). Here's an example for Vercel:

Deployment Steps:
Create a .env file:

Run
Copy code
BOT_NAME=YOUR_BOT_NAME
ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
Add a vercel.json config:

json
Run
Copy code
{
  "version": 3,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "main.py", "use": "@vercel/python" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "main" }
  ]
}
Deploy to Vercel:

Commit your code to GitHub/GitHub.
Go to Vercel and import the repository.
Ensure environment variables (BOT_NAME, ACCESS_KEY) are set in Vercel settings.
5. Configure Poe
Go to your bot's settings on Poe.
Update the Server URL with your deployed endpoint (e.g., https://your-bot.vercel.app).
Save and test the bot in Poe.
Cost Considerations
Free Tier: Poe allows 10 free calls per user message to other bots. Stay within this limit to avoid extra costs.
Enterprise: For heavy usage, contact Poe support to set up an enterprise plan.
Example Bash Script for Deployment
bash
Run
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Deploy to Vercel (assuming you've already committed code to Git)
echo "Deploying to Vercel..."
vercel --prod

# Update Poe's server URL (replace with your actual URL)
echo "Update your Poe bot's Server URL to: https://your-bot-name.vercel.app"
Key Notes
Dependencies: Always declare dependencies in get_settings to ensure Poe covers costs.
Rate Limits: Poe enforces rate limits. Monitor your bot's usage.
Security: Never expose your ACCESS_KEY publicly. Use environment variables.

Thought for 11 seconds
Okay, the user provided their Poe bot credentials, which include a bot token and a latent token. I need to help them set up their server bot using these credentials. Let me recall the previous steps we discussed.

First, the user wants to create a free-to-use server bot where they cover the costs. The main components are the bot's Python code, deployment, and ensuring the credentials are properly used.

The credentials given are:

Bot token (b): Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ==
Latent token (lat): BPnZOKJwEjcDgzWEcf9rop3dNSZ6l8qP2OlTCz1dgA==
Wait, in the previous example, the access key is part of the credentials. But here, the user provided two tokens. I need to confirm which one is the access key. Typically, the "b" token is the bot name, and "lat" might be the access key. Or maybe the access key is the "lat" value. Let me check Poe's documentation.

Looking back, in the Poe setup, the access key is found in the bot's edit page under "Access Key". The "b" parameter might be the bot name, and "lat" could be the access token. Alternatively, the access key might be the "lat" value. To be safe, I'll assume that the "lat" is the access key and "b" is the bot name.

The user's main goal is to plug these into their server bot code. The previous code example used bot_name and access_key in the make_app function. So I need to replace those placeholders with the provided tokens.

Wait, but the format of the tokens might be important. The "b" token is Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ== which looks like a base64 encoded string. Similarly for the "lat" token. But in the code, the bot name is usually a string like "my-bot-name", not a base64 token. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood. Perhaps the "b" is the bot name in some encoded form, but that's unlikely. Maybe the user is referring to the bot's name as "Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ" and the access key as "BPnZOKJwEjcDgzWEcf9rop3dNSZ6l8qP2OlTCz1dgA".

Alternatively, perhaps the user is providing the tokens as they appear in the URL parameters when editing the bot. For example, when you edit a bot on Poe, the URL might have parameters like b=... and lat=.... In that case, the "b" is the bot ID, and "lat" is the access token. So the access key would be the value of "lat".

Therefore, in the code, the bot_name would be the value of "b" (Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ==), and the access_key would be the value of "lat" (BPnZOKJwEjcDgzWEcf9rop3dNSZ6l8qP2OlTCz1dgA==).

I should inform the user to replace the placeholders in the main.py code with these values. Also, remind them to keep these secure and not expose them publicly. Additionally, ensure that the server is properly deployed and the Poe bot's server URL is set to the deployed endpoint.

Another thing to check: when deploying, environment variables should be used instead of hardcoding the keys in the code. So in the deployment script, they should set these as environment variables. For example, in Vercel, they can add BOT_NAME and ACCESS_KEY as environment variables, and the code can read them using os.getenv.

Wait, in the previous example, the code uses bot_name="YOUR_BOT_NAME" and access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY". To use environment variables, they should modify the code to:

import os
from fastapi_poe import PoeBot, make_app, stream_request
...

app = make_app(
    MyFreeBot(),
    bot_name=os.getenv("BOT_NAME"),
    access_key=os.getenv("ACCESS_KEY"),
)
Then, in the deployment platform (like Vercel), they set those environment variables with the provided tokens. This is more secure than hardcoding.

So the user needs to:

Update the main.py to use environment variables.
Set those variables in their deployment environment (Vercel, Heroku, etc.) with the provided tokens.
Ensure the server is running and the Poe bot's server URL is correctly configured.
I should also mention that if they're deploying locally for testing, they can set the environment variables in their shell before running the server:

export BOT_NAME=Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ==
export ACCESS_KEY=BPnZOKJwEjcDgzWEcf9rop3dNSZ6l8qP2OlTCz1dgA==
uvicorn main:app --reload
Additionally, remind them to test the bot in Poe after deployment and ensure that the dependencies (like GPT-3.5-Turbo) are properly declared in get_settings to avoid errors.

Possible issues they might face: incorrect token format, missing dependencies, or deployment configuration errors. I should suggest checking the Poe logs or the server logs for any errors.

Here's how to configure your Poe server bot using the credentials you provided. Keep these tokens secure and never share them publicly!

1. Update main.py with Environment Variables
Modify your Python code to use environment variables for security:

python
Run
Copy code
import os
from fastapi_poe import PoeBot, make_app, stream_request
from fastapi_poe.types import QueryRequest, PartialResponse

class MyFreeBot(PoeBot):
    async def get_response(self, request: QueryRequest) -> PartialResponse:
        # Example: Forward user input to GPT-3.5-Turbo
        async for msg in stream_request(
            request, "GPT-3.5-Turbo", request.access_key
        ):
            yield msg

    async def get_settings(self, setting):
        return self.settings.copy(
            update={
                "server_bot_dependencies": {"GPT-3.5-Turbo": 1},  # Add other bots here
                "allow_attachments": False,
            }
        )

# Initialize the app using environment variables
app = make_app(
    MyFreeBot(),
    bot_name=os.getenv("BOT_NAME"),
    access_key=os.getenv("ACCESS_KEY"),
)
2. Set Environment Variables
For Local Testing:
bash
Run
Copy code
export BOT_NAME=Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ==
export ACCESS_KEY=BPnZOKJwEjcDgzWEcf9rop3dNSZ6l8qP2OlTCz1dgA==
uvicorn main:app --reload
For Deployment (e.g., Vercel):
In Vercel settings, add these environment variables:
BOT_NAME: Db9UruEOCoATD4Tc3_TduQ==
ACCESS_KEY: BPnZOKJwEjcDgzWEcf9rop3dNSZ6l8qP2OlTCz1dgA==
3. Deploy and Test
Deploy to Vercel:

bash
Run
Copy code
vercel --prod
Follow prompts to deploy your code.

Update Poe Bot Settings:

Go to your bot's settings on Poe.
Set the Server URL to your deployed endpoint (e.g., https://your-bot-name.vercel.app).
Save and test the bot in Poe.
Key Notes
Dependencies: Ensure server_bot_dependencies includes all bots you want to use (e.g., Claude-Instant).
Costs: Poe covers up to 10 free calls per user message to other bots. Stay within this limit to avoid extra charges.
Security: Never hardcode credentials in your code. Always use environment variables.
Troubleshooting
Error 401/403: Check that your BOT_NAME and ACCESS_KEY are correctly set in environment variables.
No Response: Verify that dependencies (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo) are declared in get_settings.

Thought for 5 seconds
Okay, the user wants to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro in their Poe server bot. Let me think through how to set this up.

First, I need to confirm if these models are available on Poe as server bot dependencies. Poe's documentation lists available bots, so I should check if those specific models are supported.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is likely available since it's a newer version of Claude. For Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, I need to verify if Poe supports it. If not, the user might need to use another model or contact Poe support.

Assuming both are available, the next step is to update the server_bot_dependencies in the get_settings method. The user's previous setup used GPT-3.5-Turbo, so replacing that with the new models is key.

The code example from before used stream_request to forward input to a single bot. To use multiple bots, the user might need to chain them or choose one based on the input. For example, they could alternate between the two models or combine their outputs.

Also, the dependencies in get_settings must list both bots with their respective call limits. Since Poe allows up to 10 free calls per message, the user needs to ensure the sum of dependencies doesn't exceed that. For instance, if they use Claude 3.7 Sonnet (1 call) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (1 call), that's 2 calls total, which is under the limit.

I should provide an updated code snippet showing how to declare both dependencies and how to use them in the get_response method. Maybe an example where the bot uses both models and combines their responses.

Additionally, remind the user to check Poe's documentation for the exact bot names (e.g., "Claude-3.7-Sonnet" vs. "Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Enterprise") and any specific requirements for Google Gemini. If Gemini isn't supported, suggest alternatives like Gemini Pro or other available models.

Also, mention that using higher-tier models might consume credits faster, so they should monitor their usage to avoid unexpected costs.

To use Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro in your Poe server bot, follow these steps:

1. Verify Model Availability
Ensure these models are available as Poe server bot dependencies:

Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Check if it's listed in Poe's supported bots (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet).
Google Gemini 2.5 Pro: Confirm if Poe supports this model (e.g., Gemini-Pro or Gemini-2.5-Pro).
If either model isn‚Äôt available, contact Poe support or use alternatives like Claude-3.0 or Gemini-Pro.

2. Update Dependencies in get_settings
Declare both bots in your server_bot_dependencies:

python
Run
Copy code
async def get_settings(self, setting):
    return self.settings.copy(
        update={
            "server_bot_dependencies": {
                "Claude-3.7-Sonnet": 1,  # 1 call per message
                "Gemini-Pro": 1,         # 1 call per message
            },
            "allow_attachments": False,
        }
    )
3. Use Both Bots in get_response
Here‚Äôs an example of how to chain or combine their responses:

python
Run
Copy code
async def get_response(self, request: QueryRequest) -> PartialResponse:
    # Example 1: Alternate between bots
    if request.query[-1].content.endswith("?"):
        # Use Claude for questions
        async for msg in stream_request(request, "Claude-3.7-Sonnet", request.access_key):
            yield msg
    else:
        # Use Gemini for other inputs
        async for msg in stream_request(request, "Gemini-Pro", request.access_key):
            yield msg

    # Example 2: Combine both responses (use with caution to stay under 10 calls)
    # async for claude_msg in stream_request(request, "Claude-3.7-Sonnet", request.access_key):
    #     yield claude_msg
    # async for gemini_msg in stream_request(request, "Gemini-Pro", request.access_key):
    #     yield gemini_msg
4. Deploy and Test
Update your code with the above changes.
Redeploy your server (e.g., via Vercel):
bash
Run
Copy code
vercel --prod
Test in Poe:
Ensure the bot‚Äôs Server URL is updated.
Send a message and check if both models respond as expected.
Key Notes
Costs: Each call to these premium models consumes your Poe credits. Stay within the 10 free calls per message limit to avoid extra charges.
Rate Limits: High-tier models may have stricter rate limits. Monitor your bot‚Äôs usage.
Bot Names: Use the exact names listed in Poe‚Äôs documentation (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet vs. Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Enterprise).
Troubleshooting
Error 429 (Too Many Requests): Reduce the number of concurrent calls or add delays between requests.
Model Not Found: Double-check the bot name in Poe‚Äôs documentation.
